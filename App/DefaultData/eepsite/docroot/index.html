# If you have a 'split' directory installation, with configuration
# files in ~/.i2p (Linux), %APPDATA%\I2P (Windows),
# or /Users/(user)/Library/Application Support/i2p (Mac), be sure to
# edit the file in the configuration directory, NOT the install directory.
# When running as a Linux daemon, the configuration directory is /var/lib/i2p
# and the install directory is /usr/share/i2p .
# When running as a Windows service, the configuration directory is \ProgramData\i2p
# and the install directory is \Program Files\i2p .
